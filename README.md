# CarRegistrationPlateRecognition-P
1.Using Tensorflow and computer vision the project detects registration plate in a car. &lt;br> The model can also detect realtime with the help of your webcam The model is using ObjectDetection API of tensorflow for number plate detection I have done transfer learning from pretrained model ssd_mobilenet model For the license plate dataset I have used a kaggle dataset whose image and annotaions are in the image folder Trained in 6000 steps you can tune the model according to your needs and better accuracy This template can be used for any object detection model by making few changes in the code
